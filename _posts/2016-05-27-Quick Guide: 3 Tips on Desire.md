**## Quick Guide: 3 Tips on Desire**
I just finished listening to the book “Think and Grow Rich” by Napoleon Hill. So, after listening to Julien Blanc’s video about desire leading to unhappiness, I realized there’s a divide here.

Napoleon Hill says, what you desire needs to be on your brain constantly. Julien Blanc says, having desire means to have a lack of said thing you desire. This scarcity equates to unhappiness.
Now, what do I think? What has helped me? The answers are these 3 things.

### 1.Spending Time Away
You must give yourself space from your thoughts and desires. Yes, to crave is better than being indifferent. But, like most things, too much desire can be a bad thing. The same way that people fast for health, you should fast from yourself. There should be periods in your life where you focus on just “being” instead of “doing”. Fasting mentally can be done several ways. You can meditate or focus on simple breathing exercises. As the book “ 4-hour Workweek” describes, you can try a “low-information” diet. To craving this means, spend less time reading about your special thing. I meditate, and go out with my girlfriend when I need a break from the grind. Give yourself a break from the constant chatter.

### 2. Learn about other things.
The entrepreneur, and education guru Tai Lopez talks of having a wide knowledge base. He says that he even reads a book a day. This process of learning about other things leads to becoming eclectic. You can develop a niche all your own because you can derive ideas from a range of sources. Not only will your desires come to place, but they’ll be fresh and unique. This idea is even expanded upon in Robert Greene’s book “Mastery”. After reaching a high level in your craft, you can can extend it further by becoming good at something else. Then, combining the two. I try to listen to diverse subjects apart from my personal desires.

### 3. Keep It To Yourself!
This might remind you of a teacher or your parents, but it really is good advice. There is the idea that if you tell people about it, then you have a commitment to do it. Otherwise you’re risking reputation and trust. But, how often do people really do that. How many people really care? If you’re a big name company who doesn’t keep their word then maybe. You must keep your desires to yourself. When you tell people your desires, a part of your ego is satisfied, even if you never fulfill said desire. Which creates this weird paradox of feeling satisfied but have nothing to show for it. In extreme cases your ego might become inflated, so that when you achieve real success you wont be able to enjoy it.
